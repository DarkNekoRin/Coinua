# C O I N U A

Hi, If you want read this in [Spanish Version](https://github.com/DarkNekoRin/Coinua/blob/master/Readme-Spanish.md)

This was the first Hackathons that I participated.
It was sponsored by BCP (Financial Bank in Peru) and Bellatrix (Software Company) in June 2018 in Lima, Peru.
It was called Hackatrix 2018.
The idea of the Hackathon was to sell Fintech business ideas.

## R O L  üõ†Ô∏è

* _Business Ideas_
* _Building the layout (HTML + CSS) _
* _Define Gamification Mechanics_


## B A C K G R O U N D üöÄ  

The first thing we proposed to be able to put the business idea were:
* Financial Advisor with IA 
* CrowdFounding/CrowdLeanding

Most of the group chose to carry out a CrowFounding, so I started making the sketches.

## I D E A - D E - N E G O C I O üöÄ  

We wanted to do a CrowdLending App with Gamification mechanics.

The idea was to promote the community loan, one by one (P2P). That a person who wants to invest with greater interest and have money could give it to someone who needs it. We are inspired by the informality of loans that exist in the country. These systems have a high interest rate, and it is not supervised by any bank.

We wanted to maintain anonymity on both sides, but make the lender aware the risk by showing him the Financial System Score of the other person + an emotional comment from the lender.

If there is any problem or higher risk, the bank could intervene if it is given a percentage of the recovery.

* The putting Quinoas iconography that looked like interconnected nodes (P2P) was a great idea
* Not everything have been done. It is not important to focus on Login or Profile in a Hackathon. Only the essential functionalities
* The colors should be more according to the company that leads the Hackathon. We chose a red color (but this is also used by another Financial entity) which was a bad move + the UI looks very strong
